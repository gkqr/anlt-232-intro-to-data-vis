    "## What is Tableau?\n",
    "[**Tableau**](https://www.tableau.com/) is a leading data visualization and business intelligence tool that enables users to analyze data and generate insights through interactive dashboards and reports. Unlike coding-based tools such as Dash, Tableau provides a **drag-and-drop interface** that allows users to build visualizations with minimal programming knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Intro to Tableau](images/intro_to_tableau.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tableau** is widely used in industries such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and operations due to its ability to quickly process large datasets and create compelling data stories. Organizations use Tableau for tasks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sales and revenue analysis** ‚Äì Tracking company performance and trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer segmentation** ‚Äì Identifying key customer groups based on behaviors.\n",
