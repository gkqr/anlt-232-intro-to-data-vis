    "## Introduction to Multi-Page Dash Applications\n",
    "In a typical Dash application, all the content is displayed within a **single page**. However, for more extensive applications, it's necessary to split the content across multiple pages, keeping the user interface (UI) organized and easy to navigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Dash, this can be achieved by **combining several page layouts** and managing the routing of URLs. The routing is handled using Dash's built-in `dcc.Location` component, and navigation between pages is done using `dcc.Link`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "- `dcc.Location`: This component is used to track the URL in the browser. It helps Dash update the content dynamically based on the current URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dcc.Link`: This component allows users to navigate between pages by clicking links. It's akin to a traditional HTML hyperlink.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Callbacks**: Dash‚Äôs callback system will update parts of the UI based on the URL, meaning the content changes according to the current page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up the Project Structure\n",
    "A multi-page Dash app is typically organized into multiple Python files or directories. Below is a simple example of the folder structure for a multi-page application:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "/dash_project\n",
    "    /pages\n",
    "        page_1.py\n",
    "        page_2.py\n",
    "    app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `app.py` contains the main Dash app layout and routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `page_1.py` and `page_2.py` are the individual pages that you can navigate to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Main Application (`app.py`)\n",
    "First, let's set up the core of the multi-page Dash app. Create a file called `app.py` which serves as the entry point for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# app.py\n",
    "import dash\n",
    "from dash import dcc, html\n",
    "from dash.dependencies import Input, Output\n",
    "\n",
    "# Import pages\n",
    "from pages.page_1 import page_1\n",
    "from pages.page_2 import page_2\n",
    "\n",
    "app = dash.Dash(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "# App Layout\n",
    "app.layout = html.Div([\n",
    "    dcc.Location(id=\"url\", refresh=False),  # Tracks the URL in the browser\n",
    "    html.Div([\n",
    "        dcc.Link(\"Go home\", href=\"/\", style={\"padding\": \"10px\", \"marginRight\": \"20px\"}),  # Added padding and margin\n",
    "        dcc.Link(\"Go to Page 1\", href=\"/page-1\", style={\"padding\": \"10px\", \"marginRight\": \"20px\"}),  # Added padding and margin\n",
    "        dcc.Link(\"Go to Page 2\", href=\"/page-2\", style={\"padding\": \"10px\"}),  # Added padding\n",
    "    ], style={\"display\": \"flex\", \"flexDirection\": \"row\", \"alignItems\": \"center\"}),  # Flexbox for horizontal alignment\n",
    "    html.Div(id=\"page-content\")  # Where page content will be rendered\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Callback to update the page content based on the URL\n",
    "@app.callback(\n",
    "    Output(\"page-content\", \"children\"),\n",
    "    [Input(\"url\", \"pathname\")]\n",
    ")\n",
    "def display_page(pathname):\n",
    "    if pathname == \"/page-1\":\n",
    "        return page_1()  # Calls page_1.py\n",
    "    elif pathname == \"/page-2\":\n",
    "        return page_2()  # Calls page_2.py\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return html.H1(\"Welcome to the Multi-Page App!\")  # Default page\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating the Pages (`page_1.py` and `page_2.py`)\n",
    "Now that we have the main app structure set up, let‚Äôs create the individual pages. These pages will contain their own layouts and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Page 1 Layout (`page_1.py`)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# page_1.py\n",
    "import dash\n",
    "from dash import html\n",
    "\n",
    "def page_1():\n",
    "    return html.Div([\n",
    "        html.H1(\"Page 1: Visualization 1\"),\n",
    "        html.Div([\n",
    "            html.P(\"This is the first page of the app. Here, you could display a plot or other visualization.\"),\n",
    "        ])\n",
    "    ])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Page 2 Layout (`page_2.py`)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# page_2.py\n",
    "import dash\n",
    "from dash import html\n",
    "\n",
    "def page_2():\n",
    "    return html.Div([\n",
    "        html.H1(\"Page 2: Visualization 2\"),\n",
    "        html.Div([\n",
    "            html.P(\"This is the second page of the app. Display another visualization or content here.\"),\n",
    "        ])\n",
    "    ])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, both `page_1.py` and `page_2.py` define a function that returns a layout for each page. When the user navigates to one of these pages, Dash loads the appropriate layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation of the Components\n",
    "### `dcc.Location`\n",
    "The `dcc.Location` component tracks the current URL. It updates every time the user clicks a link or navigates through the app. It doesn't reload the entire page but allows you to change the content of the app dynamically based on the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `dcc.Link`\n",
    "The `dcc.Link` component is used to create links between pages. Each link changes the URL, which triggers the callback that updates the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callbacks for Dynamic Content\n",
    "Callbacks are essential for a Dash app. In a multi-page application, callbacks are used to check the current URL (`Input(\"url\", \"pathname\")`) and then render different layouts or content based on that URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the callback function `display_page` checks the URL and returns the appropriate page content. If the URL is `/page-1`, it calls the function in `page_1.py`; if it‚Äôs `/page-2`, it calls the function in `page_2.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Application\n",
    "To run the multi-page app, navigate to the directory where `app.py` is located and execute the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the server starts, open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8050/. You should see the home page with links to *\"Page 1\"* and *\"Page 2.\"* Clicking these links will dynamically update the content to show the respective pages without a full page reload.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extending the App\n",
    "You can extend this multi-page app by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding more pages and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating interactive visualizations for each page using Dash‚Äôs graphing components (`dcc.Graph`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using dynamic content loading (e.g., loading data based on URL parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you could create a page that takes user input (via a form or dropdown) and updates the visualizations accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary and Next Steps\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "- Multi-page Dash apps provide a way to organize content across multiple pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dcc.Location` tracks the URL, and `dcc.Link` allows for easy navigation between pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The content for each page can be dynamically updated using Dash callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main structure involves defining different page layouts and using callbacks to determine which layout to display based on the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Lesson Preview\n",
    "In the next lesson, we'll explore stateful interactivity and advanced callbacks create more complex interactions between components."
