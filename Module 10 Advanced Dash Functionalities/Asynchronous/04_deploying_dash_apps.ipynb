    "## Render\n",
    "**Render** is a **cloud computing platform that facilitates the deployment**, hosting and execution of applications, databases, scheduled tasks and other services. It's often described as an easy-to-use platform that combines the ease of platforms like Heroku with the power and flexibility of more traditional cloud providers like AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "Some key features and offerings of Render include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Web application deployment**: Render allows you to deploy web applications in various languages and frameworks, including Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Django and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Private services**: These are applications or jobs that are not exposed to the Internet but can be used by other applications in Render.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scheduled tasks**: Allows executing periodic jobs, similar to Cron jobs (a utility used for scheduling tasks) in Unix systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Databases**: Render supports the deployment of databases such as PostgreSQL and offers a persistent storage solution for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deployment from repositories**: You can connect your GitHub or GitLab repository and configure automatic deployments every time you push to your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Render** has earned a positive reputation for being an attractive option for developers and startups looking for a quick and easy way to deploy and scale applications without the administrative overhead of more traditional solutions."

    "Before deploying, we need to ensure that our Dash application is **structured correctly** for production. The following steps are crucial:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Ensure `server` is Exposed\n",
    "When running locally, we use `app.run(debug=True)`, but for deployment, we need to expose the WSGI server by adding:\n",
