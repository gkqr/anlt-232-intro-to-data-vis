# ANLT 232: Introduction to Data Visualization

Welcome to the official repository for **ANLT 232: Introduction to Data Visualization** in the University of the Pacific's Master's in Data Science program. This repository contains lesson materials, resources, Jupyter notebooks, and Python scripts that you can use throughout the course.

## Course Overview

This course will cover fundamental concepts and techniques for effective data visualization, including:
- Storytelling with Data
- Building Data Visualizations
- Dynamic Visualizations
- Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
- Best practices for creating clear and impactful visualizations

The materials in this repository are designed to help you follow along with lectures, complete assignments, and deepen your understanding of the data visualization process.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To access the materials in this repository, you will first need to clone it to your local machine. Open a terminal/command prompt and use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anlt-232-intro-to-data-visualization.git
```

Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.

### Install the Required Packages
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate into the cloned directory:

```bash
cd anlt-232-intro-to-data-visualization
```

The repository includes a `requirements.txt` file that lists all necessary Python packages for this course. To install these packages, make sure you are in your desired environment (e.g., a `conda` environment), then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the required dependencies for running the Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts in this course.

### Running Jupyter Notebooks
To start working with the Jupyter notebooks, activate your Python environment and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser where you can navigate to and open the notebooks.

### Running Python Scripts
If you prefer to run Python scripts outside of Jupyter, you can execute any `.py` files directly in your terminal with:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

### Recommended Python Environment
I recommend using a `conda` environment to manage the packages and dependencies for this course. To create a new environment, run:

```bash
conda create --name intro-to-data-vis python=3.10
```

Activate the environment with:

```bash
conda activate intro-to-data-vis
```

After activation, install the dependencies by running:

```bash
conda install -r requirements.txt
```
